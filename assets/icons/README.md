Icon for gamepads_types_database by volkov is marked with CC0 1.0 Universal. To view a copy of this license, visit https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

This icon has couple of famous gamepads in background, which then slightly blurred, and on top of that question mark is placed, symbolizing "Which gamepad is this?"

If you want, you can place this icon somewhere in "Credits" window of your game.

I know, this icon looks kind of... not great, but if someone could draw better, please, open PR with better one.
